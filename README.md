## Roadmap

#### Planned

- [ ] Distribute settings over several Tab Views (UX requirement)
- [ ] Allow for more global shortcuts (technical requirement)
- [ ] Permanently set the hidden/shown status of
  - [ ] Sidebar
  - [ ] Toolbar
  - [ ] Tab
  - [ ] Path
  - [ ] Status Bar
- [ ] Always open windows in icon, list, column, or cover flow view
- [ ] Add a relaunch Finder button with a global shortcut
- [ ] Add a Launch at Login checkbox (using the Service Management framework instead of the shared file list visible in User & Groups > Login Items)
- [ ] Add an Export Settings button
- [ ] Use current front-most window size and position as Defaults
- [ ] Reposition DMG disk image windows without resizing them
- [ ] Set Sidebar width
- [ ] Add app localization

#### Not Planned

- [ ] Fit column width to contents (names of items) for the selected column height
- [ ] Dual pane windows (side-by-side windows)
- [ ] Catch "Quit Finder" from the usually hidden menu item (deliberately and permanently) and keep FinderFix waiting graciously for the user to "manually" start Finder again
- [ ] Allow other application windows to be repositioned and resized through FinderFix (e.g. Terminal)

#### Will Not Be Implemented

If your feature request can be done without messing with kernel extensions that require disabling the *System Integrity Protection* (*SIP*), I promise I will try! That's why the following features will not be implemented:

- **What about adding Chromium Tabs to Finder windows?**

  I like Chromium Tabs and their early injection in Finder could be easily implemented in FinderFix. The only catch is obviously having to disable *SIP*.

- **Is there any way to get the colored Finder labels feature from TotalFinder? That is my last TF holdout feature.** 

  Again, this would require disabling *SIP*.

  > The bad news. Tags are not Labels. "Colouring-in" a file/folder is now not really possible. You should no longer expect to visually identify a file... - from a discussion on the Apple Support Community
